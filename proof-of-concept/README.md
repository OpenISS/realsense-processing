#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/12/f03c15/000000?text=+) Important: There is a new project which succeeds this one: [github.com/cansik/realsense-processing](https://github.com/cansik/realsense-processing)

This project is just a proof of concept on how to use the RealSense D400 cam series together with processing. I am currently working on a Java interface to access the RealSense cameras.

Processing IDE Example:

* [/examples/RealsenseViewer](https://github.com/cansik/realsense-processing/tree/master/examples/RealsenseViewer)

You find the java interface repository here (build it with [gradle 4.9 or lower](https://github.com/cansik/realsense-processing/issues/2#issuecomment-450195961)):

* [https://github.com/cansik/librealsense](https://github.com/cansik/librealsense)

which is based on

* [https://github.com/edwinRNDR/librealsense](https://github.com/edwinRNDR/librealsense)
